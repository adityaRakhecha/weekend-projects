# my first chrome extension
+ This weekend I made a chrome extension which contains my shortcuts to my linkedin, github, twitter and my facebook accounts. 
+ You can download the my_extension folder and then add it to chrome extension page via 'Load unpacked' button. 
+ You can also edit it and make your extension with your design and shortcuts.
+ Also extensions like screenshot, open camera, etc. can also be made.
+ Here is the picture of my extension :
