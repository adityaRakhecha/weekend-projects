# my first chrome extension
+ This weekend I made a chrome extension which contains my shortcuts to my linkedin, github, twitter and my facebook accounts. 
+ You can download the my_extension folder and then add it to chrome extension page via 'Load unpacked' button. 
+ You can also edit it and make your extension with your design and shortcuts.
+ Also extensions like screenshot, open camera, etc. can also be made.
+ Here is the picture of my extension :

+ For more details and help check this [official documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide).
+ Since the pattern I have used in manifest.json file makes this extension a cross browser extension which simply means you can add this extension to any browser and can use it without making any different version of it for different browser.
